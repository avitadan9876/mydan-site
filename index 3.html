    <h1>MyDan & Avital</h1>
    <div class="story">
        Once upon a time, there were two birds born from the same nest.<br>
        Though their wings were made to fly, each took a different sky.<br><br>
        One soared high, curious and brave.  
        The other stayed closer, thoughtful and gentle.<br><br>
        Time passed, and the winds of life brought them back into view.<br>
        In a moment of silence, they recognized each other â€“  
        not by sight, but by soul.<br><br>
        This is the story of two birds, once apart, now reflecting the sky within each other.
